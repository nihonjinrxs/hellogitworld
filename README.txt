This is a sample project students can use during Matthew's Git class.

We can have a bit of fun with this repo, knowing that we can always reset it to a known good state.  We can apply labels, and branch, then add new code and merge it in to the master branch.

As a quick reminder, this came from one of three locations in either SSH, Git, or HTTPS format:

* git@github.com:matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git
* git://github.com/matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git
* https://matthewmccullough@github.com/matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git
